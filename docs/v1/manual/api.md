# API

The API is a collection of reusable functions that helps to reduce the size of a package, or for developers to communicate with Commander externally. As the API is exposed to the server context, please be aware of backdoors, as they may have codes to intervene Commander.

# Reasons to use

There are many reasons to use the API over a custom implementation when available, not just to maintain consistency across every packages in your Commander installation, but also for your own goods when making packages for Commander. Here's a few of the reasons to use the API:

- Consistency

By using the API for your packages, this creates a higher consistency between each other, ensuring the quality remains the same.

- Less duplicates

Write less line for the same functionality -- The API is a collection of reusable functions, in which your packages can make use of the API to do a Commander-specific task (fetching administrator info, etc), without writing the implementation again and again for each package.

- Safer

The API is constantly maintained by the Commander team, your packages always stay up-to-date and safe-to-use when we update the API. A custom implementation has to be maintained by the one who coded it, and when there is an update for Commander which affects the implementation, then the package is likely to be affected.

### Global API

If you plan to integrate your game's system with Commander, you can consider to use our global API, stored in the `_G` environment with name `CommanderAPI`.

The global API is not available for clients context however, only communicate with Commander in server context as it's safer.

Here is the list of all available methods in the global API, the reference of the methods are exactly the same as the one in the builtin API unless specified.

- checkHasPermission
- checkAdmin
- getAdminLevel
- getAvailableAdmins
- getAdminStatus
- getAdmins
